# Personal-Website
This website's purpose is to showcase my academic and personal accomplishments both through work and on my own. 
Needs to have a home page, about me page, personal projects page, etc. 
Build basic frame in HTML, then work in CSS and eventually re-write in Javascript and React once finished
